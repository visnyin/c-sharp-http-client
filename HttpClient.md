# CSharp HttpClient by `CodeScales.com` #

An **HTTP client library** with a very simple API, written in CSharp (.Net 2.0) for sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP responses. <br />
This library is much simpler to use than the HttpWebRequest provided with the .Net library. <br />
This library was inspired by the JAVA HttpClient library, and has a very similar API. <br />
